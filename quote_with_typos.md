“There are people like Senhor José everywhere, who fill their tiem, or
what they believe to be their spare time, by collecting stmps, coins,
medals, vases, postcards, matchboxes, boks, clocks, sport shirts,
autographs, stones, clay figurines, empty beverage cans, little angels,
cacti, opera programmes, lighters, pens, owls, music boxes, bottles, bonsai
trees, paintings, mugs, pipes, glass obelisks, ceramic ducks, old toys,
carnival masks, and they probably do so out of something that we might
call metaphysical angst, perhaps because they cannot bear the idea of
chaos being the one ruler of the universe, which is why, using their
limited powers and with no divine help, they attempt to impose some order
on the world, and for a short while they manage it, but only as long as
they are there to defend their collection, because when the day comes when
it must be dispersed, and that day always comes, either with their death
or when the collector grows weary, everything goes back to its beginnings,
everything returns to chaos.”

*― José Saramago, All the Names*
